# Auto-Reconnection Features Documentation

## Overview

The Student Lab System now includes comprehensive auto-reconnection functionality that ensures all devices (Entry Scanners, Exit Validators, and Admin Dashboards) automatically reconnect when network connectivity is restored or when the server comes back online.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Heartbeat System
- **Heartbeat Interval**: Every 10 seconds
- **Connection Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Heartbeat Response**: Server responds to each heartbeat with status information
- **Stale Connection Detection**: Automatically closes connections that don't respond to heartbeats

### 2. Automatic Reconnection Logic
- **Exponential Backoff**: Reconnection delays increase with each attempt (3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, 48s)
- **Max Attempts**: 5 reconnection attempts before giving up
- **Smart Retry**: Only retries when connection is actually lost, not on temporary network hiccups
- **Connection State Tracking**: Maintains connection state and reconnection attempt count

### 3. Device Discovery & Network Monitoring
- **Network Scanning**: Devices scan the network every 15 seconds to discover other devices
- **Server Discovery**: Automatic server discovery when devices come back online
- **Device Count Display**: Real-time display of connected devices
- **Network Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for network health

### 4. Enhanced Connection Status UI
- **Connection Status**: Shows current connection state (Connected/Disconnected)
- **Network Status**: Displays network availability (Online/Offline)
- **Device Count**: Shows number of connected devices
- **Retry Counter**: Displays current reconnection attempt (e.g., "Retry 2/5")
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status with animations for better visibility

### 5. Offline Queue Management
- **Data Persistence**: All student registrations are stored locally when offline
- **Automatic Sync**: Queued data is automatically synced when connection is restored
- **Retry Logic**: Failed sync attempts are retried with exponential backoff
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures no data loss during network interruptions

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side Enhancements

#### Connection Monitoring
```javascript
// Enhanced connection monitoring with timeout detection
function startConnectionMonitoring() {
  setInterval(() => {
    const now = Date.now();
    const disconnectedDevices = [];
    
    for (const [wsClient, info] of devices.entries()) {
      if (!info.lastSeen || (now - info.lastSeen > CONNECTION_CONFIG.CONNECTION_TIMEOUT)) {
        disconnectedDevices.push({ ws: wsClient, info });
      }
    }
    
    // Handle disconnected devices and notify admins
  }, CONNECTION_CONFIG.DEVICE_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL);
}
```

#### Device Discovery Broadcasting
```javascript
// Periodic device discovery broadcasts
function broadcastDeviceDiscovery() {
  const discoveryMessage = {
    type: 'device_discovery',
    serverInfo: {
      host: 'localhost',
      httpPort: HTTP_PORT,
      httpsPort: HTTPS_PORT,
      wsPort: WS_PORT,
      wssPort: WSS_PORT
    },
    connectedDevices: Array.from(devices.values())
  };
  
  // Broadcast to all connected devices
}
```

### Client-Side Enhancements

#### Enhanced Reconnection Logic
```javascript
function attemptReconnection() {
  if (connectionAttempts >= maxReconnectAttempts) {
    console.log('Max reconnection attempts reached');
    return;
  }
  
  connectionAttempts++;
  const delay = reconnectDelay * Math.pow(2, connectionAttempts - 1); // Exponential backoff
  
  reconnectTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    setupWS();
  }, delay);
}
```

#### Heartbeat System
```javascript
function startHeartbeat() {
  heartbeatInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (ws && ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'heartbeat' }));
      
      // Check for stale connections
      const timeSinceLastResponse = Date.now() - lastHeartbeatResponse;
      if (timeSinceLastResponse > 30000) {
        ws.close();
      }
    }
  }, 10000);
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Connection Settings
```javascript
const CONNECTION_CONFIG = {
  HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 10000,        // 10 seconds
  CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 30000,        // 30 seconds
  RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS: 5,            // Max reconnection attempts
  RECONNECT_DELAY: 3000,            // Base reconnection delay (3 seconds)
  DEVICE_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL: 5000,  // 5 seconds
  NETWORK_SCAN_INTERVAL: 10000      // 10 seconds
};
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Hotspot Disconnection
1. **Device loses hotspot connection**
2. **System detects disconnection** within 30 seconds
3. **Offline queue activates** - all new registrations stored locally
4. **Reconnection attempts begin** with exponential backoff
5. **When hotspot reconnects**, device automatically reconnects to server
6. **Offline queue syncs** - all pending data is uploaded
7. **Normal operation resumes**

### Scenario 2: Server Restart
1. **Server goes down** (maintenance, crash, etc.)
2. **All devices detect disconnection** via heartbeat timeout
3. **Devices enter offline mode** and queue all operations
4. **Server comes back online**
5. **Devices automatically reconnect** when they detect server availability
6. **All queued data is synchronized**
7. **System returns to normal operation**

### Scenario 3: Network Interruption
1. **Network becomes unstable** (WiFi issues, router problems)
2. **Devices experience intermittent connectivity**
3. **Heartbeat system detects connection issues**
4. **Automatic reconnection attempts** with smart backoff
5. **When network stabilizes**, devices reconnect automatically
6. **Data integrity maintained** throughout the process

## Testing
